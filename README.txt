I proudly present a cool optimization project about a famous problem called ”the multi- armed bandit problem” Although many algorithms for the problem are well-understood theo- retically and easy to perform, but they always view it as a problem about trade-off between exploration and exploitation. In this project, I will view it as an optimization problem. This is interesting and there are some deep insights. I will perform some widely used algorithms and compare their performance to different test setting.


the code is in matlab file. the result graphs are in result graphs file.
